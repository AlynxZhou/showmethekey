"Usage:\n"
"\n"
"1. Please input admin password after toggling the switch, because it needs "
"superuser permission to read input events, and Wayland does not allow "
"running graphics program with superuser permission, so it uses polkit to run "
"a backend with superuser permission. This program does not handle or store "
"your password. Users in `wheel` group can skip password authentication.\n"
"\n"
"2. After you toggle the switch to show the floating window, you need to drag "
"it manually to anywhere you want, because Wayland does not allow window to "
"set its position. Though the floating window is mostly transparent for "
"click, the \"Clickable Area\" label on titlebar are clickable and can be "
"dragged as a handle.\n"
"\n"
"3. Because Wayland does not allow a window to set \"Always on Top\" and "
"\"Always on Visible Workspace\" by itself, you should set it manually if you "
"are in a Wayland session and your window manager support it.\n"
"For example if you are using GNOME Shell (Wayland), you can right click the "
"\"Clickable Area\" on title bar to show a window manager menu and check "
"\"Always on Top\" and \"Always on Visible Workspace\" in it.\n"
"If you are using KDE Plasma (Wayland), you can right click \"Floating Window "
"- Show Me The Key\" on task bar, check \"Move to Desktop\" -> \"All "
"Desktops\" and \"More Actions\" -> \"Keep Above Others\".\n"
"\n"
"4. If you want to temporary pause it (for example you need to insert "
"password), you can use the \"Temporary Hide\" switch, it will not record "
"your keys while hiding.\n"
"\n"
"5. Set Timeout to 0 if you want to keep all keys.\n"
"\n"
"You can open this dialog again via menu icon on title bar -> \"Usage\"."
