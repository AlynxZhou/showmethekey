"Usage:\n"
"\n"
"1. Please input your password after toggling the switch, because it needs "
"superuser permission to read input events, and Wayland does not allow "
"running graphics program with superuser permission, so it uses polkit to run "
"a backend with superuser permission. This program does not handle or store "
"your password.\n"
"\n"
"2. After you toggle the switch to show the floating window, you need to drag "
"it manually to anywhere you want, because Wayland does not allow window to "
"set its position. Though the floating window is mostly transparent for "
"click, the \"Clickable Area\" label on titlebar are clickable and can be "
"dragged as a handle.\n"
"\n"
"3. Because Wayland does not allow a window to set \"Always on Top\" and "
"\"Always on Visible Workspace\" by itself, you should set it manually if you "
"are in a Wayland session and your window manager support it. For example if "
"you are using GNOME Shell, you can right click the \"Clickable Area\" in "
"titlebar to show a window manager menu and check \"Always on Top\" and "
"\"Always on Visible Workspace\" in it.\n"
"\n"
"You can open this dialog again from Menu -> Usage."
